# This is an example for a bug report.

* Typescript complains if imports end in .ts instead of.js
* Vite should work with .js (in fact, it did in my project until it suddenly stopped working with one file, and at some point while reducing to this minimum example it stopped working with a previously working file too.)
* I could be making an elementary mistake, as I have not been using Typescript for long.
